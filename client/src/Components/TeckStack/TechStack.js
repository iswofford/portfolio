            Organizers for PegaWORLD have relied on traditional, manual
            processes for managing the annual 3-day conference: PDF agendas,
            printed materials, and spreadsheets of attendees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feedback from event coordinators and attendees has highlighted the
            critical need for modernizing the day-to-day logistics of the
            conference.

              My task: Based off my own experience, I was required to identify a
              single aspect of managing or attending a conference on which to
              focus.

            Use any design method you think most suitable to showcase a possible

          You may use whatever front-end technologies you deem appropriate for
          your prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
          Comply with minimum WCAG 2.1 Level A accessibility requirements. You
          should be able to speak to specific areas of accessibility within your
          prototype.

          <li>
            Utilize Pegaâ€™s design system from design.pega.com for typography,
            color palette, and any information architecture or interaction
            patterns you feel are appropriate.
